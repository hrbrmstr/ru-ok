*Additional information:* The above data is gathered via RIPE Atlas. The measurement connects via SSL/TLS (i.e. this is *not* application layer) to port 443 with the SNI set to the corresponding domain. This checks that the port is open and responsive *and* that a secure connection can be established, but not necessarily that the service itself is functioning. However, if the connection *failed* we may be able to expect that the service is down as well. Not all sites run HTTPS (ex. `kremlin.ru` does not) - but for those that were *previously* known to use HTTPS, this would reasonably indicate that those HTTPS services are down.
